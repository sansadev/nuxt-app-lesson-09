          <h2>Yoga Basics</h2>
          <p>
            Yoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating mind, body and spirit to achieve a state of enlightenment or oneness
            with the universe. What is normally thought of as “yoga” in the West is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga. The different paths of yoga
            emphasize different approaches and techniques, but ultimately lead to the same goal of unification and enlightenment.Though yoga’s ultimate aim is lofty,
            its essence is practical and scientific as it emphasizes direct experience and observable results.  It is not a religion, but a practice of personal
            inquiry and exploration.  As the cultural and religious diversity of practitioners attest, yogic philosophy speaks to universal truths that can be
            incorporated within any belief system.
